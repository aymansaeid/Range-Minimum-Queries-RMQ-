# Range-Minimum-Queries-RMQ-
Range Minimum Queries (RMQ): Algorithms and Experimental Analysis


The main goal of this project is to study and implement algorithms for solving the Range Minimum
Queries (RMQ). You are expected to use research methods, including literature search, designing and
conducting experiments, collecting data and analyzing the results to investigate solutions to the RMQ.
Project Tasks:
1. Problem Description : Provide the formal definition of RMQ.
2. Algorithms* : Provide a detailed description of each approach and analyze the theoretical
performance. Algorithms are as follows: (1) Precompute all, (2) Sparse table, (3) Blocking, (4)
Precompute none.
3. Implementation : Implement the algorithms in Java or C.
4. Experimental Design : Design and conduct experiments to analyze time complexities of each
algorithm empirically.
5. Results : Provide experimental results. Your report can include graphs, tables, and
charts to visualize the performance comparisons.
6. Conclusion : Summarize key insights gained from the comparative analysis.
